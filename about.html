            <p class="aboutText"> Hi, my name is Daniel Hartgrove. Welcome to my website.
            <br><br>
            Since I began programming at age 11 making simple games and animations in Scratch I have developed a keen interest in the production of video games and system applications. Throughout secondary school,
            I programmed for fun in Scratch, Python and Visual Basic and achieved high grades in all of my related school work. By Sixth Form, I had a working knowledge of VB, Java and Python under my belt and was able to produce and design an application
            to simulate natural selection designed as a teaching tool for biology classes. This was my first experience with simulation and computational autonomy. During this project, I discovered a love for designing and developing user interfaces,
            starting with paper and TKinter. Now, as a student at the University of Nottingham, I am specialising in Software Development modules with a keen interest in UI/UX design. It was here that I picked up an interest in Web design.
            <br><br>
             As a side hobby throughout my time at school, I found graphic design work to be exciting and interesting to learn about. I have since developed my love of Graphic Design into a side project to show off my skills creatively, which can be found 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pngrove/">here</a>. In the future, I hope to continue to merge my love of design and computing to publish original yet inspired content in the form of web design, software development and graphics.</p>
