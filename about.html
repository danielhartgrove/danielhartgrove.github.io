                <p class="aboutText"> Hi, my name is Daniel Hartgrove. Welcome to my website.
                <br><br>
                Since I began programming at age 11 making simple games and animations in Scratch I have developed a keen interest in the production of video games and system applications. Throughout secondary school,
                I programmed for fun and had produced many simple applications. By Sixth Form, I had a working knowledge of VB, Java and Python and to produced an application
                to simulate natural selection designed as a teaching tool for biology classes. During this project, I discovered a love for designing and developing user interfaces,
                starting with paper and TKinter. Now, as a student at the University of Nottingham, I am specialising in Software Development with an interest in Frontend Development and UI/UX design.
                <br><br>
                Frontend design is not my only interest however, as I enjoy games design and graphic design among other forms of art in the computational adjacent fields. As an example of this, when I was in sixth form I worked with a friend in creating mods for popular online shooter Star Wars Battlefront II.
                These mods are available for download on the internet, and involved registry editing, retexturing, and 3D modelling.
                <br><br>
                I am currently looking to further my studies in programming as well as graphic design. Currently, I am advancing my knowledge of frontend development with the intention of learning full-stack development. My goal is to merge my two interests together to create something unique, original and helpful.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I'm working on writing sorting libraries for C++ with the intention of creating my own sorting algorithm. Next, I would like to use C to develop some computer graphics. I am also working on a website for a tourist location, which can be found <a href="http://www.widmerfields.uk/">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                As a side hobby throughout my time at school, I found graphic design work to be exciting and interesting to learn about. I have since developed my love of Graphic Design into a side project to show off my skills creatively, which can be found 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pngrove/">here</a>. In the future, I hope to continue to merge my love of design and computing to publish original yet inspired content in the form of web design, software development and graphics.</p>
