                <p class="aboutText"> Hi, my name is Daniel Hartgrove. Welcome to my website.
                <br><br>
                Since I began programming at age 11 making simple games and animations in Scratch I have developed a keen interest in the production of video games and system applications. Throughout secondary school,
                I programmed for fun in Scratch, Python and Visual Basic and achieved high grades in all of my related school work. By Sixth Form, I had a working knowledge of VB, Java and Python and was able to produce and design an application
                to simulate natural selection designed as a teaching tool for biology classes. This was my first experience with simulation and computational autonomy. During this project, I discovered a love for designing and developing user interfaces,
                starting with paper and TKinter. Now, as a student at the University of Nottingham, I am specialising in Software Development with an interest in Frontend Development and UI/UX design. It was here that I picked up an interest in Web design.
                <br><br>
                Web design is not my only interest however, as I enjoy games design and graphic design among other forms of design in the computational adjacent fields. In sixth form, through lockdown, I worked with a friend in creating mods for popular online shooter Star Wars Battlefront II.
                These mods are available for download on the internet, and involved registry editing, retexturing, and 3D modelling.
                <br><br>
                I am currently looking to further my studies in programming as well as graphic design. Currently, I am advancing my knowledge of frontend development, soon to branch out into backend development. My goal is to merge my two interests together to create something unique, original and helpful.
                <br><br>
                I am currently working on a few personal projects, which will be available on my GitHub page. As a part of them, I am looking to develop my skills in web design (focused on JavaScript) and UI/UX design, which I hope to showcase on this website in the future.
                <br><br>
                As a side hobby throughout my time at school, I found graphic design work to be exciting and interesting to learn about. I have since developed my love of Graphic Design into a side project to show off my skills creatively, which can be found 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pngrove/">here</a>. In the future, I hope to continue to merge my love of design and computing to publish original yet inspired content in the form of web design, software development and graphics.</p>
