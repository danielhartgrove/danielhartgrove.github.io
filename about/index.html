            <p class="aboutText"> Hi, my name is Daniel Hartgrove. Welcome to my website.
                <br><br>
                Since starting my programming journey at the age of 11, wherein I crafted simple games and animations using Scratch, my fascination with video game production and system applications has grown significantly. Throughout my secondary school years, I engaged in programming for leisure, culminating in the creation of numerous basic applications. By the time I reached Sixth Form, I had acquired a proficient understanding of VB, Java, and Python. Notably, I developed an application designed to simulate natural selection, serving as an educational tool for biology classes.
                <br><br>
                During the course of this project, my passion for designing and developing user interfaces flourished, commencing with sketches and progressing to the utilization of tools such as TKinter. Currently enrolled at the University of Nottingham, I am specializing in Software Development, with a particular focus on Frontend Development and UI/UX design.
                <br><br>
                Although my primary interest lies in Frontend development, I am equally enthusiastic about game design and graphic design, along with other art forms in computational-adjacent fields. A noteworthy example of this multifaceted interest is my collaboration, during Sixth Form, in creating mods for the popular online shooter Star Wars Battlefront II. These mods, available for download online, involved intricate tasks such as registry editing, retexturing, and 3D modeling.
                <br><br>
                Presently, I am seeking to advance my studies in programming and graphic design. My ongoing pursuit involves enhancing my expertise in frontend development, with a future plan to delve into full-stack development. My overarching goal is to seamlessly integrate my dual interests to produce distinctive, original, and valuable creations.
                <br><br>
                On the programming front, I am currently engaged in writing sorting libraries for C++, intending to develop my proprietary sorting algorithm. My next endeavor involves utilizing C for computer graphics development. Concurrently, I am working on a website for a tourist location, accessible here.
                <br><br>
                As a side pursuit throughout my academic journey, I found graphic design to be both captivating and intellectually stimulating. This passion has evolved into a dedicated project showcasing my creative skills, available here. In the future, my aspirations include further merging my love for design and computing to produce original, yet inspired, content in the realms of web design, software development, and graphics.
                <br><br>
                Please feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn, both of which are accessible via the socials tab.
