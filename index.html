                                <p class="maintext">Farming Frenzy is a game I created in Unity to demonstrate game design concepts. The gameplay loop revolves around
                                    careful resource management, with the aim of maintaining a "happiness" value on your farm by ensuring that the animals
                                    are well looked after and crops are being grown in suitable time. Across five levels, the challenge is increased by 
                                    introducing new tasks on the farm, and increasing the distance between tasks to increase the player's cognitive load.
