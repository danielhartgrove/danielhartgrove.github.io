            <br>
            
            <p>The following terms and conditions apply to all transactions with Slam Dog Limited T/as Reefyll. The use of this site indicates your acceptance of these terms and conditions. The placement of an order indicates your acceptance of these terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>Please read them carefully and print a copy for future reference.</p>

            <br>
            
            <h3>General</h3> 
            
            These terms and conditions do not affect your statutory rights. To order goods through this website you must be at least 18 years of age and accept delivery within the UK. We will treat each order for goods as an offer by you to purchase the goods subject to these terms and conditions.
            <br>
            <h3>Making A Purchase: The friendly online store.</h3>
            
            Just browse our store, and add any items that you wish to buy into the shopping cart. After you have finished your selection, click on 'Checkout Basket' and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to complete the order.
            
            We accept all Major Credit Cards except American Express cards.
            
            When confirmation of order is received, this is to indicate that we have received your order. It does not indicate that a contract exists between us. We will indicate acceptance of your order, and hence a contract between us, when we send you an invoice. We have included this term to protect us in the case that a mistake has been made in pricing, we have inadvertently under-priced goods, or we are no longer able to supply a particular product for some reason. In the case of a change of price, we will always contact you first to ensure that the price is acceptable.
            <br>
            <strong>Security</strong>
            <br>
            
            Credit Card Security when the order is placed at our website is our highest priority. Credit card numbers are encrypted using the highest available encryption. 
            
            All images, descriptive matter, specifications and advertising on our site are for the sole purpose of giving an approximate description of the goods. 
            <br>
            
            <h3>Payment and Price</h3>
            <br>
            All prices on our website are inclusive of VAT and delivery charges - the price you see is the price you pay. No hidden charges.
            The total price payable for the goods will be stipulated at the time when you place your order whether or not the order has been confirmed. We are entitled to make adjustments to the price to take account of imposition of any taxes or duties, or if due to an error or omission the price published for the goods is wrong whether or not the order has been confirmed. We will inform you of the correct price and give you the opportunity to cancel the order.
            <br>
            <strong>Typographical Errors</strong>
            <br>
            In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error , taxes or duty changes, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders listed at the incorrect price whether or not the order has been confirmed. If your credit card has already been charged and we subsequently cancel your order, we will immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the value of the incorrect price (including delivery charges).
            <br>
            <strong>Payment Methods</strong>
            <br>
            On the order you must provide us with your exact billing address and telephone number - the address and phone number your credit card bank has on file for you. Incorrect information will cause a delay in processing your order. Your order will only be processed once authorisation of your credit card has been properly received. 
            <br>
            <strong>Availability of Goods</strong>
            <br>
            All products and services are subject to availability and may be withdrawn at any time. If we do not supply the goods for any reason we will not charge you for these and we will refund any money already paid for them. However, we will not be responsible for compensating you for any other losses you may suffer if we do not supply the goods.
            <br>

            Returns Policy
            
            If you change your mind or are unhappy with your product then don’t worry we offer an extended returns policy where you can return the item within 7 days for a full refund. Whatever the reason we will take your order back within 7 days for a full refund. You will be responsible for the return of the goods to us and any return shipping costs. 
            
            Once your order has been dispatched it cannot be cancelled. If you refuse an order, it will then be treated as a customer return where the return shipping costs will be deducted from your refund.
            
            Under UK Law the distance selling regulations 2000 states that a customer can return the goods for any reason within 7 days of the date after the delivery date provided it is returned with the original packaging and all items returned in the condition they were received. 
            
            If you have opened the box to examine the goods you must have done so without damaging or marking the product or packaging. The goods must not have been used . You have a duty of care whilst the goods are in your possession and as such we advise you to return the goods with their original packaging to ensure they are not damaged during transit to us. Goods received back incomplete or in a damaged or used condition will either be returned to you and the cost of delivery charged to your account or we reserve the right to levy a surcharge on such returned goods at a minimum 15% of the invoice price.
            
            How do I Return my order?
            
            Should you wish to return your goods then please contact us office@reefyll.com and we will process your return for you. Please do not write on the box as the items do need to be returned in a saleable condition. A small label will suffice. Please note that to enable you to return your goods we ask that they are returned as new with all the original packaging unopened. Unfortunately we are unable to accept returns where they have been opened, used or modified in any way. Additional charges may apply if the product is returned in a non-saleable condition.
            
             
            
            Other 
            
            You will own the goods once we have received your payment in full. We will issue you with an electronic invoice once we have dispatched the goods to you. Failure by us to enforce any of these terms and conditions will not affect our right to enforce the rest of these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are subject to change at any time without prior notice to you.

            Payment information.
            We need to take your credit or debit card information to allow us to process your payment.

            Your data will be used for two broad purposes:
            
            Marketing communications
            
            After 25th May 2018, in-line with new legislation, Slam Dog Ltd T/as Reefyll will only send marketing communications to customers who have expressly opted-in to receiving it.
            Communications relating to your purchase
            
            Slam Dog Ltd T/as Reefyll reserves the right to hold personal data for contacting you with important information about your purchase(s).

            How long do we keep your information?
            
            We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our policies.
            
            Your right to opt-out of marketing communications
            
            You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing email from us, by choosing to opt out by emailing us at office@reefyll.com .

            However, we only share the information that is necessary for any given purpose. Your data will never be sold to third parties for marketing purposes.
            
            Other individual rights
            
            From the 25th May 2018 new data protection legislation was introduced across the EU.
